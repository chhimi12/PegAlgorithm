### Peg Solitaire Solver

This Python script provides a solution to the Peg Solitaire game using a backtracking algorithm. Peg Solitaire is a classic puzzle game where pegs on a board are jumped over and removed until only one peg remains. The script uses depth-first search and backtracking to explore possible moves and find a solution.
The script will output whether a solution is found or not. If a solution exists, it will visualize the solution using an animation.

#### Code Structure

- `peg_solver.py`: Contains the main implementation of the Peg Solitaire solver.
- `animation.py`: Provides a function for visualizing the solutions through animation.
- `Node` and `peg` classes: Define the data structures for representing the game state.
